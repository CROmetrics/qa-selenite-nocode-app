# Selenite — No-Code QA Runner

A Chrome extension for building and running QA test scripts directly in your browser — no code required. Selenite lets you build a queue of browser automation steps via a side panel UI, save and reload scripts, and watch execution logs in real time.

## Features

- Side panel UI — build and run test queues without leaving the page
- Visual step builder — add, reorder, and remove automation steps
- Element picker — click any element on the page to capture its CSS selector
- Metrics section — define the metric values that fire in the browser output (often prefixed `[PJS]` or `[cro]`) and assert them during runs with the **Track Metric** step
- Save and load named scripts (stored in Chrome sync storage)
- Universal delay override — set a single delay across all steps
- Two execution modes: **close after run** or **loop continuously**
- Tab targeting: run on the **active tab** or open a **new tab**
- Console log with live output and INFO / WARN / ERR filtering, plus a live browser-console mirror with a CRO (`[PJS]`/`[cro]`) filter
- WCAG 2.2 audit suite in the **Test Suites** tab
- Stop execution at any time

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder.
5. Click the Selenite icon in the toolbar to open the side panel.

## Usage

### Building a Queue

1. Open the Selenite side panel by clicking the extension icon.
2. In the **Target** section:
   - Choose an execution mode: **Close after run** or **Loop continuously**.
   - Choose a tab target: **Active tab** or **New tab**.
3. Every queue starts with a locked **Open URL** step — enter the URL to open (leave blank to use the active tab), plus any URL parameters and the QA Mode toggle (`cro_mode=qa`).
4. Click **+ Add Step** to add automation steps to the queue.
5. For each step:
   - Select a function from the dropdown.
   - Fill in any required arguments (use the picker button `🎯` to capture selectors from the page).
   - Optionally set a per-step delay (seconds).
   - Use the checkbox to enable/disable individual steps.
6. Click **Execute** to run the queue.

### Tracking Metrics

1. Open the **Metrics** section at the top of the Build tab and click **+ Add Metric** for each console value you want to track (e.g. `Tagging: hero_cta_click`). Metrics persist across sessions.
2. Add a **Track Metric** step to the queue and pick a metric from the dropdown.
3. When the step runs, it checks the `[PJS]`/`[cro]`-tagged console output captured during the current run for that value (case-insensitive substring match). A hit logs how many times it fired; a miss logs an error without stopping the queue.

### Saving and Loading Scripts

- Enter a name in the **Script name** field and click **Save** to store the queue.
- Open the **Load Script** accordion to load or delete a saved script.
- Scripts are saved to Chrome sync storage and persist across sessions.

```json
[
  {
    "func": "click",
    "enabled": true,
    "delay": "1",
    "inputs": {
      "selector": "#submit-btn"
    }
